## Git and GitHub
Overall, I liked the presentation of the material on Coursera, especially the fact that the topics were broken into short chunks. The language is simple, no translation was needed. It's a pity that it was not possible to pass the lab tasks, but playing on [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) helped a lot in learning the commands.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
**_Linux Survival_**. Basic commands were learned quickly, for me it is easier to learn in interactive form. Liked the tasks very much.

**_HTTP_**. I have read  all the material, but can't say that I understood the information well. Maybe everything will become clearer with practice.

## Git Collaboration
In general, I liked this course, but this topic needs constant practice, because at the end I started to get confused about the differences between commands. As a result, the last levels were long and boring to get through.
It should also be noted that the classes of weeks 3 and 4 should have been assigned before the PR task (I had some difficulties and was looking for solution in the Internet, and all the answers were already there).

## Intro to HTML and CSS
I was already somewhat familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS before this, so there were no difficulties. Some things became clearer, such as positioning and using the Box Model.

## Responsive Web Design
Great presentation of the material, clear and to the point. In this part of the course learned a lot about the importance and flexibility of using Flexbox and Grid Layout. So far it's my favourite section.
